of confusion for beginners than to be a complete guide.\n\n\nYou can think of the flake.nix as an entry point and a way of acquiring dependencies (inputs) that are required for evaluation.\n\n\nA flake is simply a source tree (e.g. git repo) containing a flake.nix that provides a standardized interface to Nix artifacts (e.g. packages, modules)\n\n\nAttribute sets are all over Nix Code, they are simply name value pairs wrapped in curly braces:\n\n\n\nOutput: \"bar\"\n\n\nNote: {} is a valid attribute set in Nix.\n\n\nFlakes have what are called top-level attributes (i.e. you can access them without using dot notation). Some top-level attributes are inputs, outputs, and nixConfig.\n\n\nFlake commands are space separation for subcommands like this: nix build, the older cli commands are written with a hyphen nix-build.\n\n\nBasic Flake Structure:\n\n\nThe flake.nix file must contain an attribute set with one required attribute - outputs - and optionally description and inputs.\n\nInputs\n\n\nYou can think of inputs as the dependencies this flake relies on.\n\n\ninputs: An attribute set specifying the dependencies of the flake where the keys are the names of your flakes dependencies, and the values are references to those other flakes. To access something from a dependency, you would typically go through inputs (i.e. inputs.helix.packages)\n\n\nThe following specifies a dependency on the nixpkgs and import-cargo repositories:\n\n\n\nEach input is fetched, evaluated and passed to the outputs function as a set of attributes with the same name as the corresponding input.\n\n\nThe special input self refers to the outputs and source tree of this flake.\n\n\nEach input is fetched, evaluated and passed to the outputs function as a set of attributes with the same name as the corresponding input.\n\n\n\n\nOutputs\n\n\nYou can think of outputs as the things your flake provides (i.e. Your configuration, packages, devShells, derivations)\n\n\nFlakes can provide arbitrary Nix values, such as packages, NixOS modules or library functions. These are called outputs. Some outputs have special meaning to certain Nix commands and therefore must be a specific type. If you look at the output schema you'll see that most expect a derivation\n\n\nShow your flakes outputs with:\n\nThis command actually takes a flake URI and prints all the outputs of the flake as a nice tree structure, mapping attribute paths to the types of values.\n\n\nBeginners might initially think that self and nixpkgs within the outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... } definition are the 'outputs' themselves. However, these are actually the input arguments (which are often called output arguments) to the outputs function. This distinction is key to grasping the outputs of a flake.\n\n\nRemember that the outputs function itself takes a single argument, which is an attribute set. Even though it looks like multiple arguments { self, nixpkgs, ... }, this syntax in Nix is destructuring that single input attribute set to extract its individual fields.\n\n\nself is a way to reference \"this\" flake. You could use self.inputs to access the inputs top-level attribute. The outputs function always receives an argument conventionally named self. This argument is a reference to the flake itself including all of it's top-level attributes. You typically use self to refer to things within your own flake. (i.e. self.packages.my-package)\n\n\n\n[!NOTE]: The ... syntax is for variadic attributes, (i.e. a varying number of attributes). If you notice most flakes have many more inputs than are explicitly listed in the input arguments this is possible because of variadic attributes.\n\nIn the following example c = 2 is an extra attribute:\n\nHowever, in the function body you cannot access the \"c\" attribute. The solution is to give a name to the given set with the @-pattern:\n\n\n\n@-patterns in the outputs function argument list provides a convenient way to bind the entire attribute set to a name (i.e. outputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs).\n\n\nWhen you write outputs = { pkgs, ... } @ inputs, it does the following:\n\n\nDestructures the input attribute set: It tries to extract the value associated with the key pkgs from the input attribute set and bind it to the variable pkgs. The ... allows for other keys in the input attr set to be ignored in this direct destructuring.\n\n\nBinds the entire attribute set to inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlakes promise that the outputs of a flake should be the same regardless of the evaluator's environment. Because of this, all flake outputs that have anything to do with packages must specify the platform explicitly in some way.\n\n\nPlatform is a combination of architecture and OS. (e.g. x86_64-linux).\n\n\nlegacyPackages is designed specifically for nixpkgs. It makes it possible to work with nixpkgs arbitrary attribute format from older packages. What this means is that nixpkgs traditionally organizes packages directly under the top level (e.g. pkgs.hello), and legacyPackages provides a consistent platform-aware way to access these within the flake's structured output format.\n\n\nTo expand further, Flakes enforce a more structured way of organizing outputs. For package outputs, the expected schema typically has the platform specification as a top-level attribute (i.e. packages.x86_64-linux.my-package). This ensures that when you ask a flake for a package, it's clear which platform the package is intended for. It's kind of like an API for flakes and legacy packages to be able to work together.\n\n\n\n\nFlakes take a sole argument which is another point of confusion, how is it a sole argument if im passing { self, nixpkgs, ... }? This syntax is actually shorthand for a single argument that is an attribute set.\n\nRemember, a valid attribute set in nix is {}. { a = 1; } is an attribute set with a single value. An attribute set is simply a set of name value pairs wrapped in curly braces.(e.g. {self, nixpkgs, ... }). Notice also that in the inputs arguments commas are used and everywhere else uses semicolon ;\n\n\n\nOutputs (of the Flake): Refers to the attribute set that is returned by the outputs function.\n\n\nTo recap the outputs function takes an attribute set as its argument and returns an attribute set.\n\n\nI already covered that nixosConfigurations outputs your NixOS configuration, there can be many other types of outputs explained below.\n\n\nImports\n\n\nYou can think of import as \"evaluate the Nix expression in this file\" and return its value.\n\n\nThe import function in Nix takes a path (usually a string representating a file or directory i.e. ./lib/dev-shell.nix) and evaluates the Nix expression found at that location.\n\n\nOne point of confusion is the following:\n\n\n\n\nWith (import ./modules/desktop.nix { pkgs = nixpkgs; }) you're actually saying import the file at this location but also export nixpkgs to said file to make it available.\n\nWhen you see:\n\nYou are:\n\n\nImporting the Nix expression from ./lib/my-helpers.nix\n\n\nPassing an attribute set { pkgs = nixpkgs; } as an argument to the evaluated expression in the imported file.\n\n\nInside lib/my-helpers.nix, there will likely be a function definiton that expects an argument (often also named pkgs by convention):\n\n\n\nBy passing { pkgs = nixpkgs; } during the import, you are essentially saying: The pkgs that the code in ./lib/my-helpers.nix expects as an argument should be the nixpkgs that is available within the scope of my current flake.nix(the nixpkgs passed as an argument to the outputs function)\n\n\nWhen you use import with a path that points to a directory, Nix doesn't just try to import the directory itself (which wouldn't make sense as a Nix value). Instead, it automatically looks for a file named default.nix within that directory.\n\n\nIf a default.nix file is found inside the specified directory, Nix will then evaluate the Nix expressions within that default.nix file, just as if you had directly specified the path to default.nix in your import statement. The result of evaluating default.nix becomes the value returned by the import function.\n\n\nResources\n\n\npractical-nix-flakes\n\n\ntweag nix-flakes\n\n\nNixOS-wiki Flakes\n\n\nnix.dev flakes\n\n\nflakes-arent-real\n\n\nwombats-book-of-nix\n\n\nzero-to-nix flakes\n\n\nnixos-and-flakes-book\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/","title":"Nix Flakes Explained"},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/":{"body":"NixOS Modules\nTL;DR: In this post I break down the NixOS module system and explain how to define options. I take notes in markdown so it's written in markdown (sorry old reddit). I write about things to deepen understanding, you think you know until you try to explain it to someone. Anyways, I hope this is useful.\n\nMost modules are functions that take an attribute set and return an attribute set.\n\nRefresher:\n\nAn attribute set is a collection of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces:\n\n\n\nA function with an attribute set argument:\n\n\n\nThe simplest possible NixOS Module:\n\n\nNixOS produces a full system configuration by combining smaller, more isolated and reusable components: Modules. In my opinion modules are one of the first things you should understand when learning about NixOS.\n\n\nA NixOS module defines configuration options and behaviors for system components, allowing users to extend, customize, and compose configurations declaratively.\n\n\nA module is a file containing a Nix expression with a specific structure. It declares options for other modules to define (give a value). Modules were introduced to allow extending NixOS without modifying its source code.\n\n\nTo define any values, the module system first has to know which ones are allowed. This is done by declaring options that specify which attributes can be set and used elsewhere.\n\n\nIf you want to write your own modules, I recommend setting up nixd or nil with your editor of choice. This will allow your editor to warn you about missing arguments and dependencies as well as syntax errors.\n\n\nDeclaring Options\nThe following is nixpkgs/nixos/modules/programs/vim.nix:\n\n\nIt provides options to enable Vim, set it as the default editor, and specify the Vim package to use.\n\n\nModule Inputs and Structure:\n\n\n\n\nInputs: The module takes the above inputs and ... (catch-all for other args)\n\n\nconfig: Allows the module to read option values (e.g. config.programs.vim.enable). It provides access to the evaluated configuration.\n\n\nlib: The Nixpkgs library, giving us helper functions like mkEnableOption, mkIf, and mkOverride.\n\n\npkgs: The Nixpkgs package set, used to access packages like pkgs.vim\n\n\n...: Allows the module to accept additional arguments, making it flexible for extension in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways: A NixOS module is typically a function that can include config, lib, and pkgs, but it doesn’t require them. The ... argument ensures flexibility, allowing a module to accept extra inputs without breaking future compatibility. Using lib simplifies handling options (mkEnableOption, mkIf, mkOverride) and helps follow best practices. Modules define options, which users can set in their configuration, and config, which applies changes based on those options.\n\n\nLocal Configuration Reference:\n\n\n\nThis is a local alias. Instead of typing config.programs.vim over and over, the module uses cfg.\n\n\nOption Declaration\n\n\nThis defines three user-configurable options:\n\n\nenable: Turns on Vim support system-wide.\n\n\ndefaultEditor: Sets Vim as the system's default $EDITOR.\n\n\npackage: lets the user override which Vim package is used.\n\n\n\nmkPackageOption is a helper that defines a package-typed option with a default (pkgs.vim) and provides docs + example.\n\n\nConditional Configuration\n\n\n\nThis block is only activated if either programs.vim.enable or defaultEditor is set.\n\n\nWarnings\n\n\n\nGives you a soft warning if you try to set defaultEditor = true without also enabling Vim.\n\n\nActual System Config Changes\n\n\n\nIt adds Vim to your systemPackages, sets $EDITOR if defaultEditor is true, and makes /share/vim-plugins available in the environment.\n\nThe following is a bat home-manager module that I wrote:\n\nNow I could add this to my home.nix to enable it:\n\n\n\nIf I set this option to true the bat configuration is dropped in place. If it's not set to true, it won't put the bat configuration in the system. Same as with options defined in modules within the Nixpkgs repository.\n\n\nIf I had set the default to true, it would automatically enable the module without requiring an explicit custom.batModule.enable = true; call in my home.nix.\n\n\nModule Composition\n\n\nNixOS achieves its full system configuration by combining the configurations defined in various modules. This composition is primarily handled through the imports mechanism.\n\n\nimports: This is a standard option within a NixOS or Home Manager configuration (often found in your configuration.nix or home.nix). It takes a list of paths to other Nix modules. When you include a module in the imports list, the options and configurations defined in that module become part of your overall system configuration.\n\n\nYou declaratively state the desired state of your system by setting options across various modules. The NixOS build system then evaluates and merges these option settings. The culmination of this process, which includes building the entire system closure, is represented by the derivation built by config.system.build.toplevel.\n\n\nResources on Modules\n\n\nxeiaso Nixos Modules for fun &amp; profit\n\n\nNixOS Wiki NixOS modules\n\n\nnix.dev Module System\n\n\nnix.dev A basic module\n\n\nNixOS Flakes Book Module System\n\n\n","id":"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/","title":"NixOS Modules Explained"}},"docInfo":{"https://saylesss88.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-flakes-explained/":{"body":762,"title":3},"https://saylesss88.github.io/blog/nix-modules-explained/":{"body":489,"title":3}},"length":4},"lang":"English"}
